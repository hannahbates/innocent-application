                    <h2>i took the initiative and made something happen...</h2>
                    <p>My passion for making things better began when I re organised a stationary cupboard at Topshop aged 18. I was a local hero. We discovered stationary we never knew existed and a never ending supply of those M cubes for the hangers and blu tack.</p>
                    <p>This excitement went from strength to strength and last year my current manager and I knew our company were missing out big time by not having an in house groups sales department. We were using an external company who we're taking 10% that could have been ours. After a bit of prodding the big bosses we presented our new branding and ideas for marketing it. We got given a budget of £5000 to spend in return for a promise we'd take a certain amount in 6 months. We took ten times what they asked. By nurturing new contacts (creating colourful spreadsheets) and inviting them to see new shows first we made a lot of friends which was really fun and thrilling every time they called with another coach load of theatre enthusiasts. We also helped initiate a teachers preview club to encourage new audiences and it was really thrilling calling teachers by their first name!</p>

                    <h2>why do i want to work for innocent?</h2>
                    <p>To put it simply why wouldn't you want to? When your heart skips a beat when veg pots are on BOGOF, when you go and visit your mum and she's brought innocent cartons for kids (i.e. me her 26 year old daughter) and your face shines brighter than the refrigerators light you know you're onto a winner. Any organisation who gives me something to read and ponder whilst I'm slurping my smoothie is instantly something I want to be part of. You knit hats for smoothies for goodness sakes!</p>
                    <p>On a serious note I think this role could be the apple to my raspberry. The fact that I'm having the best time writing this application tells me a lot of what I need to know. On a day to day basis it's the customer service that I get a kick out of. I like helping people in a sticky situation, or giving them some insider information to make their experience the best I can make it. Your investment in people, commitment to your staff and the ways in which you go about that are so unique and that's something I could kill (kill meaning juice an apple) to be a part of and would equally want to give everything to.</p>
                    <p>Also Hannah* rhymes with banana.<br>*If you pronounce Hannah like har-ner.</p>

                    <p>I have a few. I ran 5k dressed as bat woman and raised £300 for a children's charity. (I know it's only 5k but I am allergic to running. Bunking PE was my antihistamine as a child)</p>
                    <p>I am, in my opinion, an incredible Aunty to a nine month old, Freya. I think this because she's said "Hannah" the other day before "mummy" or "daddy". My sister told me it was by accident but Freya winked at me and I just knew...</p>

                    <h2>i had lots on but still smiled when...</h2>
                    <p>Well firstly you should know that I once won a packet of chewits for being the best smiler whilst doing a tap routine dressed as Shirley temple so smiling has since come extremely naturally to me. I now have a total of 9 fillings and a phobia of the dentist.</p>
                    <p>I work in a small team of three and recently I lost one member to San Francisco and then my boss to long term sickness. Three peoples work became mine, all mine. Some folk swooped in to help me cover but I had to train my new heros whilst fulfilling the departments needs. I felt slightly hysterical for a total of ten minutes until I got handed some cake. Then, like a scene from Cinderella, the post-its became my best friends and I had those flags and ticks cleaning up my inbox for me. The words okie dokie, no worries and wonderful, right, next... fell out of my mouth like a never ending smoothie.</p>
